# Measuring Treatment Effects with Causal Machine Learning Techniques: 2024 Fall Final Project - Telco Churn Data Analysis

* __Team Members__: Team Members: 李信哲(B08607043), 陳毓文(R13B44010)
* __Data Source__: "Telco customer churn: IBM dataset" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset).
* __Abstract__: Our purpose and motivations are to consider this data set as a real-world business problem. We used Telco customer churn dataset to achieve two main goals: 1. Churn Prediction Models  2. Strategies to retain customers., which we beleived are the most important isusses for Telcos. 

  In the first part, we demonstrate a good prediction performance after feature engineering compared to baseline models.

  In the second part, we propose 3 strategies to retain customers, and examine those strategies with uplift models.
